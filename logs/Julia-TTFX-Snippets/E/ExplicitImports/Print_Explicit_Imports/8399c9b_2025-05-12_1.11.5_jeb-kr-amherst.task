  Module ExplicitImports is relying on implicit imports for 7 names. These
  could be explicitly imported as follows:

  using AbstractTrees: AbstractTrees, Leaves, TreeCursor, children, nodevalue
  using JuliaSyntax: JuliaSyntax, @K_str

  Additionally, module ExplicitImports has stale explicit imports for this 1
  unused name:

    •  parse is unused but it was imported from JuliaSyntax at
       /workdir/depot/packages/ExplicitImports/gBeSh/src/ExplicitImports.jl:7:20

  Additionally, module ExplicitImports explicitly imports 1 non-public name:

    •  parent is not public in AbstractTrees but it was imported from
       AbstractTrees at
       /workdir/depot/packages/ExplicitImports/gBeSh/src/ExplicitImports.jl:8:22

  Additionally, module ExplicitImports has 1 self-qualified access:

    •  parent was accessed as ExplicitImports.parent inside
       ExplicitImports at
       /workdir/depot/packages/ExplicitImports/gBeSh/src/deprecated.jl:79:21

  Additionally, module ExplicitImports accesses 1 name from non-owner modules:

    •  parent has owner AbstractTrees but it was accessed from
       ExplicitImports at
       /workdir/depot/packages/ExplicitImports/gBeSh/src/deprecated.jl:79:21

  Additionally, module ExplicitImports accesses 20 non-public names:
